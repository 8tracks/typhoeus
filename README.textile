h2. Summary

A library for interacting with web services (and building SOAs) at blinding speed.

h2. Description

A library for accessing web services in Ruby. It's specifically designed for building service oriented architectures in Ruby that need to be fast enough to process calls to multiple services within an HTTP request/response life cycle.

h2. Installation

For now HTTPMachine exists only on github. It requires you to have a current version of libcurl installed. I've tested this with 7.19.4.
<pre>
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com # if you haven't already
gem install pauldix-http-machine
</pre>
If you're on Debian or Ubuntu and getting errors while trying to install, it could be because you don't have the latest version of libcurl installed. Do this to fix:
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
</pre>

Another problem could be if you are running Mac Ports and you have libcurl installed through there. You need to uninstall it for curb to work! The version in Mac Ports is old and doesn't play nice. You should "download curl":http://curl.haxx.se/download.html and build from source. Then you'll have to install the gem again.

If you're still having issues, please let me know on the mailing list.

h2. Usage

# This will have to be extensive as there are usage patterns that may be foreign to users.

h2. Benchmarks

# Put some notes here about how wickedly, insanely fast this library is.

h2. Next Steps

* Add support for error handling. Automatic retry, exponential back-off, queuing for later
* Add server test suite
* Add put support
* Add support to get to pass in params in the options hash (instead of just as part of the url)
